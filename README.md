## Documentation repository for learning Power BI
This repo is a warehouse for helping develop learning materials for Microsoft's Power BI. It will cover several different aspects of Power BI, ranging from deployment and pricing to advanced visualizations development.

Some of this documentation is intended for public consumption. Others are particular to ICF, and have specific information that is related to setting up a Power BI shop within ICF. These ICF specific modules will be indicated as such, and should not be included in publicly published series.

This is currently a development project of my own personal time, and as a result has no established timeline. The project will include markdown of different sections of learning, and will feature two complementary formats of presentation:
1. Video learning materials
2. Markdown learning materials with text, visuals, and GIFs

Please see the following navigation links for easy movement throughout the learning material
