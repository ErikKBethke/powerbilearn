## Learning Power BI
This repo is a warehouse for helping develop learning materials for Microsoft's Power BI. It will cover several different aspects of Power BI, ranging from deployment and pricing to advanced visualizations development.

This documentation is intended for public consumption, and will be focused on content creator usage rather than administration and other aspects of enterprise level systems.

This is currently a development project of my own personal time, and as a result has no established timeline. It also will contain opinion-based perspectives when discussing the capabilities of Power BI - other opinions will vary. The project will include markdown of different sections of learning, and will feature two complementary formats of presentation:
1. Video learning materials
2. Markdown learning materials with text, visuals, and GIFs

Please see the following navigation links for easy movement throughout the learning material
